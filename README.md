## Gameplay

- Each round presents a grid of color blocks — one is slightly different
- Click the odd one out before the timer ends
- Wrong answer or timeout costs a life (3 lives total)
- Every 3 rounds = 1 Level, with a checkpoint summary showing your color analysis
- Difficulty increases each Level: finer color differences, larger grids
